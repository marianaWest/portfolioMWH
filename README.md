This is my portfolio collecting some of my projects, both the ones that I have finished (for now) and others that are still a work in progress.   
I wanted to make something simple and clear, using few colors and typography. 

# Technologies in use / Tech Stack / Built with

- JavaScript
- Bootstrap

# What I have learned

I started building my portfolio from a free template when I just started learning how to code early this year. However, after trying different templates I found them messy and I wasn't happy with the design at all. So I started over from scratch and achieve something that looks good but with no frills.  
After learning Bootstrap I refactored the code to make it more responsive. 

# What issues have I faced and how I resolved them

I had a QA professional to check it and he made some valuable suggestions -- I have implemented some changes, and I'm working on other improvements, such as replacing the heavy videos.  

# Source

This project was done as part of the 100Devs course curriculum and was built from scratch.
