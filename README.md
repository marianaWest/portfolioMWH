# My Portfolio

This portfolio collects some of my projects, both finished and wip. It was built from scratch using vanilla JavaScript and CSS. 
I wanted to make something simple and beautiful, but there are parts that I want to change. 

## Refactoring

I'm aware that the portfolio is not yet fully responsive (for example, for mobile in landscape) and that the .gifs are making it too heavy to load.
I plan to work on that shortly and also include more projects.
